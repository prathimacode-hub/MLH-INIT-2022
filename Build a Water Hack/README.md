## Watering Project

Moisture sensors and raspberry pi will only give you a high or low level

Need to interface with A-D converter or arduino to get levels and set calibration

Could also get a moisture sensor with a pot

Integrate bluetooth on the individual sensors so you don't have to run lines to the ardiuno/pi

How to make the server accessible from the web if on a different wifi network?

Think about database for storing the values to use later
