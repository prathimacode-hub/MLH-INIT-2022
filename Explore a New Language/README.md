# Hello World Program in Javascript

Inspiration drawn from EddieHub and Website Development Workshop

This is a Hello World program in Javascript. Tried it for very first time in a new language which I haven't used earlier.

I have first checked up with the web browser to see the inner glimpse of how environment works. I have tried attached this script to webpage to see how it works. To say about how did this structure into program, I have mentioned this doctype as HTML. Started my program with a <html> tag. Then added the syntax of <head> and <body>. To get the script of "Hello World", I have used <script> tag and inserted the statement into alert. I now winded up with <html> tag.

I was initially skeptical of about trying this in new language and my recent slight interest towards web development made me take this step. 

Glad I could pull this off and take this as a challenge. It's a small achievement but definitely something I feel proud of to try my hands on it.

I learnt the basic structure of how websites are developed and how they are declared using syntax.

This is just a start. Hope I can expand my horizons further to do some useful projects on Javascript.
