That's why sentiment analysis, a tool that automatically monitors emotions in conversations on social media platforms, has become a key instrument in social media marketing strategies.

In this repository, Word2Vec word embedding model has been implemented in accordance to the reasearch paper "Evaluation of Deep Learning Techniques in Sentiment Analysis from Twitter Data". To execute, run the Jupyter Notebook and import the dataset.
