# BMI Calculator GUI

## Aim:
Calculate BMI ratio

## Purpose:
It's main purpose is to calculate the Body Mass Index Ratio of a person and tell whether the person is healthy, underweight, overweight or obesity.

## Description:
Here with the help of tkinter module I had designed a helpful system for calculating the Body Mass Index Ratio. The user will enter his/her age, gender, height(in cm) and weight(in kg). The system will calculate and show the BMI of the person and will also tell that the person is underweight, healthy, overweight or obesity. 

## Workflow:
As soon as, we run the program a splash screen appears which will last for 4 sec. only and then automatically the main screen will launch(the input screen). At the input screen the user will enter his/her details like age, select his gender, then the user will enter his/her height(in cm) and weight(in kg).
When the person click on Calculate a window will appear which will show the BMI ratio of the person by calculating it as per the formula given below:
w=weight(in kg)
m=height(in m)
bmi=w/(m*m)

The user can even reset the entries by using the reset button.
Then, finally by using the exit button the person can close the application.
